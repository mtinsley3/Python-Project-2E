Research Question: Can we compare synthases for host entry receptors for influenza (sialic acid) among pigs and ferrets to determine if the latter are another reservoir for precursor avian influenza viruses between birds and humans and should be under more careful surveillance

For the code, the synthases.fasta file is needed and contains all five synthase sequences to be compared. The result includes a heatplot of all the alignment scores, which is included in 'synthasesheatplot' as a PNG file.
